## A new look to the Smart3D Data model

**Zen** is a suite of libraries and utilities dedicated to the exploration of the Intergraph Smart3D database.

Born as a personal learning aid, it quickly grew up to a complete set of tools to cover many use cases.

### Target user profile

**Zen** was built having in mind the requirements and needs of an advanced Smart3D user, a technical consultant or project administrator, to assist in the troubleshooting process or simply as an exploration aid to create and develop advanced Smart3D integration software.

### Under the Hood

The software is built for a Windows platform, and only requires the .Net Framework (ver. 4.5.2 or higher) to run.<br/><br/>
That's it.<br/>
You don't need to install the Smart3D client, nor do you need any Sql Client.<br/>
You can use **Zen** to export Excel workbooks for various purposes, but you don't even need to have MS Excel installed* to do it!<br/>

## Features

### Text Search
You can paste a list of OIDs to Zen, or you can perform a more human-friendly text search in the **whole** site.<br/>

### Easily navigate the relations
There is more to Smart3D than meets the eye! Some relationships are not self evident or easily discovered, expecially if you are looking for something in the catalog. But no more!<br/>

### Simmetry
Thanks to the visual aid and the modern user interface, you can now use graphical simmetry to find errors at a glance, or discover unexpected relations between seemingly unrelated objects.<br/>

### Item Attributes
Easily browse the attributes for each and every object you discover. You can even go a step further, and look at the raw SQL table entries underlying those attributes, without filters!<br/>

### Export Data
**Zen** lets you export attribute data to an excel workbook. You can even select more than one object and perform a comparison, even if the objects are not of the same type!<br/>

### Bulkload files
Last but not least, you can use **Zen** to export the contents of your Smart3D catalog to a set of Excel workbooks.
