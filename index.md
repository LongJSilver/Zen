## A new approach to Smart3D's Data model

**Zen** is a suite of libraries and utilities dedicated to the exploration of the Intergraph Smart3D database.

![Nodes and relations](https://github.com/LongJSilver/Zen/blob/master/img/Relations3mini.png?raw=true)

Born as a personal learning aid, it quickly grew up to a complete set of tools to cover many use cases.

### Target user profile

**Zen** was built having in mind the requirements and needs of an advanced Smart3D user, a technical consultant or project administrator, to assist in the troubleshooting process or simply as an exploration aid to create and develop advanced Smart3D integration software.

### Under the Hood

The software is built for a Windows platform, and only requires the .Net Framework (ver. 4.5.2 or higher) to run.<br/>
That's it.<br/>
You don't need to install the Smart3D client, nor do you need any Sql Client.<br/>
You can use **Zen** to export Excel workbooks for various purposes, but you don't even need to have MS Excel installed* to do it!<br/>
